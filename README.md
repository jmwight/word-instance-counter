# Word Instance Counter
##About
This project is based on exercise 6-4 of Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernigan's C Programming book. It reads all lines entered from an input. Once EOF is reached it prints out general stats about number of total words and total unique words. It then prints out all words number of occurrences. This is ordered hierachaly first in terms of number of occurrences descending, then lexicographically. All words are converted to lowercase so upper and lower doesn't matter in the input. It is interesting for collecting statistics on things like papers written. 

##Getting Started
To get started you can clone the project on the terminal by typing git clone https://github.com/jmwight/word-instance-counter. You can then build the project by typing make. This will create an executable file called word-instance-counter. To run the program simply type ./word-instance-counter. You can either type or copy text from somewhere and paste it into the program. Once done simply enter the EOF character (CTRL+D in Unix and Linux systems). The program will then generate the statistics on words. 

##Contributing
If you want to contribute you can simply fork the project. Create a branch off of main. Once ready simply file a pull request through Github. This is mainly an exercise for me but if anyone wants to contribute feel free.
